<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->




I am a curious and motivated individual with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, electronics, and software development.

My journey started at North China Electric Power University (NCEPU), where I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I spent two years at NCEPU before transferring to The University of Edinburgh to complete my studies. During my undergraduate years, I developed a solid foundation in electronics and electrical engineering, working on advanced topics such as optical communication and high-fidelity audio.

In my Master's program, I continue to delve into the exciting world of artificial intelligence, with a focus on machine learning. I strive to apply my knowledge and skills to create meaningful and impactful solutions. I believe that the intersection of AI, electronics, and software can yield transformative results across various industries and aspects of life.
